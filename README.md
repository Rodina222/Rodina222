# Hi there, I'm Rodina Mohamed 👋 

### 🚀 Data Scientist & AI Engineer 
I am an AI Engineer dedicated to solving **real-life problems** through **Data Science, Predictive Modeling, and Deep Learning**. I bridge the gap between complex data analysis and professional software engineering, building modular, scalable systems that turn raw information into actionable insights.I am backed by a strong foundation in **Communications Engineering**, **Go**, and **Python** software architecture.
